TicTacToe:
The first tic tac toe java file provides my draft for the tic tac toe project which features a console based game rather than a GUI. This console based game also does not have computer playing functionality.

TicTacToeGUI:
This game provides a user interface through java swing and allows users to interact with a tic tac toe board. The game provides two options through multiplayer option as well as a option to play a computer.
